{\bf \Large Bench Marking}

In this file I include the CPU times calculated from different pieces of code for different purposes. Each section is a different purpose and from within each the parameters are varied. The start and end times are times extracted from the CPU in some way. Only differences matter, like with potential energy.

These are all bench marked on Otter
\section{ Ensembles of system's of $N$ sites}

\begin{enumerate}

\item $N = 1$

\begin{lstlisting}
W = 10
U = 6
Mu = 3
t = 1
systems = 1000
Time << 1 second
Started (s): 3.83600E-3
Ended (s): 2.51470E-2
Difference (s): 2.13110E-2

systems = 10,000

Ended (s): 0.17492
Difference (s): 0.17113

systems = 100,000

Average per three-site cluster: $4.13\cdot 10^{-4}~\mbox{s}$ 

\item $N = 4$

\begin{lstlisting}
